# GitHub Upload and Pages Setup Instructions

## 📤 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Repository settings:**
   - Repository name: `VSCodeGames` (or any name you prefer)
   - Description: `TRS-80 Model 100 Terminal Emulator - Authentic LCD display for web browsers and e-readers`
   - Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

5. **Click "Create repository"**

## 🔗 Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```powershell
# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/VSCodeGames.git

# Rename main branch to 'main' (modern Git standard)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🌐 Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub.com
2. **Click the "Settings" tab** (at the top of the repository)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. **Under "Source"**, select:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. **Click "Save"**

## 🎉 Step 4: Access Your Live Site

After enabling Pages (may take a few minutes):

- **Your site will be available at:**
  `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/VSCodeGames/`

- **Update the README.md** with your actual GitHub Pages URL
- **Share the link** to test on your Kindle Colorsoft!

## 📱 Step 5: Testing on Kindle

1. **Open the browser** on your Kindle Colorsoft
2. **Navigate to** your GitHub Pages URL
3. **The interface should automatically scale** for the Kindle's display
4. **Tap the screen** to focus and start typing
5. **Enjoy the authentic TRS-80 experience!**

## 🔧 Making Updates

Whenever you make changes:

```powershell
# Add changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push to GitHub (automatically updates GitHub Pages)
git push
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **GitHub Pages may take 5-10 minutes** to deploy changes
- **Make sure repository is public** for free GitHub Pages
- **The main entry point is `index.html`** (GitHub Pages serves this automatically)
- **All files are ready** - no additional configuration needed!

## 🎯 Perfect for Your Kindle!

The responsive design will automatically:
- Scale to fit the Kindle Colorsoft's screen
- Adjust for high-DPI display
- Provide touch-friendly interface
- Maintain crisp pixel appearance
